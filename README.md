# About The Author
I hope you don't mind just a bit of publicity. I'm a [JavaFX and Swing Freelancer and Consultant](https://www.pixelduke.com),
but more generally can be described as a Front End Freelancer and Consultant since I also have experience in web technologies,
building web apps, etc, and have experience in User Interface Design and User Experience. If you need professional assistance 
feel free to [contact me](https://www.pixelduke.com/contact).  
Still this is, and will remain being, a free and open source library, so feel free to use it, royalty free, in your projects commercial or not.
